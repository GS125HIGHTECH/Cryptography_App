## Description

The Cryptography Application is a Python tool that enables encoding and decoding text using three different methods: Base64, Vigenère cipher, and ROT13.

## Features

- **Base64 Encoding**: You can input text and encode it using Base64 encoding.
- **Base64 Decoding**: You can input Base64-encoded text and decode it to retrieve the original text.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: You can use the Vigenère cipher to encode or decode text with a specified key by choosing the appropriate option.
- **ROT13**: This simple method shifts letters in the text by 13 positions in the alphabet, allowing for quick encoding and decoding.
- **Weather**: The app allows you to enter a city and check the current weather conditions for it.

## Saving Results

- You can save the result to a file by selecting "File" -> "Save" from the menu.

## Additional Options

- "Edit" -> "Undo" and "Edit" -> "Redo" allow you to undo and redo actions on the entered text.
